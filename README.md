# devity-tools
Pure REACT developer productivity tool for developers by developers.

Devity-Tools.com is a developer productivity tool written in REACT. Devity takes a dashboard & widget approach to providing UI. Anyone can build widgets via this open-source project.

Widgets can (must) be written as pure REACT components, and can persist data (or configuration) via api.devity-tools.com as JSON objects stored in MySQL's native JSON DB Type. Also, widgets can use various other APIs. 

There are two widgets in the 'widgets' folder to provide examples. A simple RSS reader and a more complex widgets for JIRA Cloud. Take note of CORS issues as APIs that cannot whitelist devity-tools.com will require a proxy built into api.devity-tools.com. For interesting projects we will build a proxy.

To be accepted, widgets should be contained within their own file (not multiple files). Save, delete, maximize, etc, are provide by widget chrome control.

There is occasionally funding available for great ideas! There is support available for the integration of commercial products.
